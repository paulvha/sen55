## ===========================================================

A program to set instructions and get information from an SEN55. It has been
tested to run I2C communication on UNOR4, Artemis ATP, UNOR3, ATmega, Due, ESP32

<br> A detailed description of the findings are in SEN55.odt

## Getting Started

I have done a number of projects on air-sensors, including the SPS30 from Sensirion. 
This is a version of a working driver + examples.
More work continues to happen to create examples and compare against other sensors.

## Prerequisites
